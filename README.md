# Smart Parking Capacity Enforcement System 🚗
## Hack Energy 2.0 – Team Trishulx
An AI-Powered Smart Parking Capacity Enforcement System designed for Municipal Corporations to monitor parking capacity in real time, prevent illegal parking, and improve urban traffic management.
##  Problem Statement
Urban municipal areas face serious parking issues due to lack of real-time monitoring and automated enforcement. This results in:
• Over-parking and illegal parking  
• Traffic congestion and road blockages  
• Increased fuel consumption and pollution  
• No centralized smart monitoring system  

This project solves these issues using AI, IoT, and Cloud technologies. 
##  Solution
The system uses CCTV cameras and AI (YOLO + OpenCV) to detect and count vehicles in real time.

Key functions:
• Real-time vehicle detection and counting  
• Live parking capacity monitoring  
• Automatic alerts when parking is full  
• Illegal parking detection  
• Admin dashboard for authorities  
• Citizen mobile/web app for parking availability  
• Cloud storage and analytics
